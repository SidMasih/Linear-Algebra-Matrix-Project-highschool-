# Linear-Algebra-Matrix-Project-highschool-
High school project that preforms matrix operations in either a comand line environment or program that uses the operations directly within its code

#Linear Algebra Matrix Operatons

Meant to be extended into other programs where matrix operations would need to be used (also includes a basic command line demo program)

User can: 

* add, subtract, multiply matrices
* invert matrices
* transpose matrices
* row reduce matrices
* find eigenvalues
* find vector projections
* return a string version of an equation that best fits a collection of points in matrix form
